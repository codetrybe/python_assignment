# Python Assignment

This is a python assignment repository. The assignments should be organized in folders that have your name on it. Please don't edit another person's file under any circumstance.

When editing, utilize branches so that you don't end up destroying either your work or other's works.

```bash
#  For creating and going straight to your branch
git checkout -b branch_name # Only if the branch doesn't exist
# For step by step
git branch branch_name # Create a branch
git checkout branch_name # For going to your branch
```

Please refer to [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/codetrybe/python_assignment/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding your assignments
